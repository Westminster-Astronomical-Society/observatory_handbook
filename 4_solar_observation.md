# Solar Observations

```{warning}
Failure to follow proper procedures while observing the Sun could result in
damage to equipment and instantaneous permanent eye injury to you or your
guests. If you are not confident about any steps of this, please seek advice
prior to attempting solar observing.

## Instructions for Solar Observing at the Roelke Observatory

1. Perform all regular steps for activating the telescope up through just prior
   to removing the dust cover.

2. Make sure the telescope is in the shade (rotate dome to a position that
   shades the telescope if necessary).

3. Make sure the telescope is in the home position.

4. Remove the 14" solar filter from its box. It is a silvered piece of fragile
   glass in an aluminum mount.

5. Take the filter to a sun-lit area, either inside or outside the dome.

6. Hold up to sun, look for cracks or large scratches in the glass surface.
   These will stand out brightly in the sun. If you find any, discontinue solar
   observing and seek advice prior to using. Seeing a few very tiny pinholes is
   acceptable.

7. Remove the dust cover from the main telescope. Install the solar filter in
   its place. Check that it is in no danger of falling off.

8. In a similar manner, check and place solar filters on the finder and low
   power telescope, if provided. If not placing solar filters on these
   telescopes, do not remove their dust covers. Follow the regular procedure
   until you are to the point of slewing to your first target. Install a low
   power eyepiece (32 mm or 40 mm, for example). This will give you the widest
   field for finding the sun (which is harder to find than you might think!).

9. Your should find the sun as a target under solar system objects or planets,
   it is typically the very last one on the list.

10. Check once more that the solar filters are securely in place.

11. Choose to slew to the sun. The telescope may flash a warning message, OK the
    warning to slew.

12. Rotate the dome such that the telescope aperture is in the sun.

13. The telescope will slew to near the sun's location. Check for it in the
    finder (only if it has a solar filter in place!), and align it to center. If the
    image seems uncomfortably bright, discontinue using it for solar observing and
    seek advice.

14. If not in the finder, try to minimize the size of the telescope's shadow
    using small slews. Then recheck that the sun is in the finder.

15. Check for the sun in the main telescope. Tweak the alignment using the hand
    controller until approximately centered. The telescope should only need
    minor tweaks every half-hour or so to keep the sun in the field of view. If
    the image seems uncomfortably bright, discontinue using it for solar
    observing and seek advice. If the finder shows the sun off center when the
    sun is centered in the main telescope, align the finder to the main
    telescope.

16. Focus the telescope as required. Occasionally look into the telescope to
    verify the centration of the sun in the field, and that the image does not
    appear to be uncomfortably bright.

## Shutting Down

1. Follow the standard instructions until the telescope is in the home position.
   Do not remove the solar filter yet.

2. After homing, rotate the dome such that the sun is no longer on the telescope.

3. Remove the solar filter, install the dust cover.

4. Carefully return the filter to its box.

5. Repeat for other telescope's sun filters.

6. Complete the standard shutdown procedure.
