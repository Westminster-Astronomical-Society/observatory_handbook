# Welcome to the Blaine F. Roelke Observatory

This handbook is intended as a guide for Westminster Astronomical Society
members in the scheduling and operation of the Roelke Observatory at Bear
Branch Nature Center. It includes training requirements, scheduling procedures,
observatory operation and some general astronomy references.

The Blaine F. Roelke Memorial Observatory (BFRMO) is home to our primary
instrument, a Celestron 14-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope previously owned
by Mr. Roelke. The telescope is mounted on a Celestron CGE Pro computerized
German-Equatorial mounting, which in turn is mounted atop a Pier Tech model II
motorized pier.

The building features a 3-meter diameter Ash dome. Siding and painting were
provided by Carroll County Parks and Recreation.

The observatory is equipped with AC electrical service as well as white and red
lighting. An exterior concrete pad is available for telescopes set up by
visitors. Electrical service for these is provided by exterior outlets on the
observatory.
