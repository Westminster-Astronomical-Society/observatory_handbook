# Opening and Closing Procedures

```{note}
You must have confirmation of your observatory use request from the Observatory
Director (or Observatory Chairman) and have permission from BBNC before arriving
at the observatory. BBNC requires a minimum of 24 hours notice prior to using
the observatory. Scheduling procedures are in [chapter
one](before_observing:scheduling) of this guide.
```

## Opening and inspection of the facilities

When you arrive at the observatory do a walk around of the facilities and check
for any storm damage or vandalism and if there is any major damage, or the
observatory or nature center facilities are left unsecured, notify the observatory
director or nature center personnel immediately.

Upon completion of observatory training you will be provided with an observatory
key-code. Open the observatory door using your provided key-code (do not share
with anyone else or use another member's code) and turn on the outside
"occupied" light by the door. There are red and white interior observatory
lights as well. It is recommended you use the white lights until startup
procedures are complete and you are ready to begin observations.

`````{admonition} Use caution
:class: warning
The door to the observatory is very low. Use caution entering and exiting the
observatory or moving around other areas of low clearance!
`````

Hang a red light on the BBNC sign at the bottom of the driveway, making sure it
is visible from the care-taker's residence. A red LED flashlight or a bright red
"glow stick" works well. You may choose to bring a light of your own or
use the one that is provided in the observatory. This is not required for BBNC
or Outdoor School personnel.

Open an obervervatory user's log (in the binder on the desk). The log should
include the date and time the observatory was opened, the operators name, other
members and guests, a short description of your intended use, general observing
conditions, and any other information that may be of interest to members and
staff. You should also document any problems with equipment or facilities and
any steps taken to correct them. See the {ref}`user-log` in appendix 1.

## Equipment inventory and inspection

The observatory director will alsoprovide you with the code to the lock-box
holding keys for the accessory cabinet (eyepieces, cameras, laptop, etc.) The
large lower cabinet holds the WASI eyepieces and accessories, the small upper
cabinet is for Bear Branch and Outdoor School Staff.

Conduct an inventory and inspect any of the equipment and accesories you intend
to use. The telescope should be parked in the home position, pointing North with
the OTA in the top center position. The telescope should be bagged and have all
dust covers in place and the be in the lowest position. Note any discrepencies
or problems in the observatory log.

## Dome operation

The dome should be securely closed with the slit pointing to the southeast. If
there is any sign of leaking or water damage around the base of the dome make a
not in the log and notify the observatory director.

Open the observatory slit before uncovering the telescope aperture (particles
rain down when opening). Use the long hook/cordless drill combination to hook
the eyelet on the dome (alternatively, use the manual hook hanging above the
desk). Turn counter-clockwise to open, run drill motor at a reasonable speed,
not fast. If intending to observe low to the horizon, just proceed with
opening. If intending to observe higher objects, or if windy, pull the release
chain on the lower part of the door while starting to crank open to leave the
lower portion of the slit-door in place. Once there is a few inch gap between
the sections, you can let go of the chain. Note that it is much easier to open
the slit if you are on the ladder, even if you are tall.

If it ishot in the observatory, point the slot into the wind (and/or away from
the sun if still daylight) and prop the door of the observatory open until ready
for use.

## Telescope startup procedures

Uncover the telescope. Remove aperture cover. Install a low power eyepiece in
both telescopes (higher focal length eyepieces are low power--try something in
the 30 to 50 mm range).

Plug in telescope (12 v power supply) to outlet at base of pier, if it isn't
already (usually left plugged in). This power supply is under the pier. Plug
pier into the same outlet if required (also generally left plugged in). Turn on
the 12 v power supply, the red pilot light should come on.

Power on the telescope with switch on south side of pier, red pilot light
should come on.

### Startup from hibernation

It should ask you if you want to wake it from hibernation (may
take 10 seconds or so), press Enter (please be careful not to press Undo at
this step). If you are instead asked to choose an alignment option, stop and
use section F below.

## Closeout procedures
